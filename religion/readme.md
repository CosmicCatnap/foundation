# Religion
Religion is a tricky subject for an archive concerned with how a society will recover from a collapse as its ability to persuade could be considered dangerous and is somewhat antithetical to Asimovs original Foundation, never the less the concepts and references in religion color and shape every piece of art and culture for most of our history and to not include it would be to present large holes in our world that would be potentially more haphazard if filled by speculation, and so we will include reasonable versions of all major religions here as well as secondary texts which do not fall into the realm of philosophy.
