# Survival
No archive for the end times would be complete without a section dealing explicitly with survival. The core goal of this subject is to provide practical, reliable, and searchable information for survival under a wide range of scenarios and environments. General works of survival will be stored in the root of this directory while works dealing with very specific topics will be labled under a directory with that topics name.

## Example 
a fictional book named "How to survive anything: 100 ways" would go in `foundation/survival`
"Nuts and Seeds: 1001 different types" would go specifically under `foundation/survival/foraging`

Critical texts often include military survival guides and reference material for topics related to field medicine and surviving off the land.
