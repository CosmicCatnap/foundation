# Military Manuals

United States manuals in particular are to be saught after. FM 3 classifications in particular followed by FM 4 and FM 5. FM 21 is a stretch goal and any other FM or JP classifications are purely for sport. Naturally you are looking for any manuals that say "Survival" and while newer editions that are available are ideal, even older editions still provide valuable information that will be inaccessible in a collapse.

# Field Guides

Field Guides provide basic information concerning particular topics in the field, typically there are two that are of value to us

1. Boy Scout Fieldbook
2. Peterson Field Guide to Edible Plants

# General Inspiration

Survival is not easy, and a non-trival part of it is mindset. While many of the military manuals go into this they are often sparse and amount to suck it up or die, which works for some but not for others. The following books should be included as addition motivation.
