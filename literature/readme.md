# Literature
Literature is is a critical subjet to archive and luckily one of the easiest as text is a medium requiring very little relative disk space and the age of well regarded literature is sometimes in the millenia, meaning that much of it is in the public domain. Similar to music though what constitutes good literature is difficult and subjective, but luckily there are many well established works that have been discussed at length and we can determine the works which have had an impact on our culture based on their ability to survive successive generations of scrutiny and still find themselves often read and discussed.

## Selection
Selection is based largely on academic popularity, with the state of book reviews in commercial spaces being essentially useless in assigning value to a work. Some works are of such significance that they nearly demand inclusion such as the works of Homer, and some will be excluded because while critical they fit better in another subject such as the king james bible which is much more appropriately stored in the religion directory of the archive. Since the medium of text is also so sparce and can be easily stored by nearly any computer with little storage requirements, it is also the focus of the literature section not to archive works, but artists and their entire bibliographies, meaning that selections have an unfortunate bias against people who were prolific. Literature does not include poetry or works indended to be performed such as plays, these items are stored in the poetry and theater sections respectively, they will also include edge cases such as Dante's Inferno which should be in poetry.
