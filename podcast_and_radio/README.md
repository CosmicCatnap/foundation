Radio is a medium that spans the modern world and many radio broadcasts hold significant value for people during our time and as such they deserve archival.

Podcasts are an important part of our world and have largely taken the place of radio shows and performances. Due to the wide range of topics and the important journalistic work that has often fallen to podcasters to do in recent years many critical works are religated to the title of podcast even though the name as a whole is often associated with expendible and frivilous consumtion of media. The foundation takes the stance that there are many podcasts that are both limited in their scope and powerful works that represent our culture so we enumerate several here and a series of "best of" representations of them that can be collected.
