Many films compose soundtracks more than worthy of storage alongside albums in music, but because they have a deep association to another work (film) they should be stored here. This seems fair as albums which depict movies will still stay in the music section such as Led Zepplin and their assication with bot the book Lord of the Rings and the films in this archive.
